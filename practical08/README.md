# Iterative and Recursive Greatest Common Denominator Algorithms

## Iterative GCD

To compile: 
` gcc gcd_iterative.c -o gcd_iterative `

To run: 
` ./gcd_iterative`

Output and user input: 

What two numbers would you like to find the greatest common denominator of? 
Enter two integers 
12 18
2nd number was bigger than first number ... switching order 
 
Your numbers are 18 and 12 

GCD= 6 (found using iterative approach)



## Recursive GCD

To compile: 
` gcc gcd_recursive.c -o gcd_recursive ` 

To run: 
` ./gcd_recursive`


Output and user input: 

What two numbers would you like to find the greatest common denominator of? 
Enter two integers 
56 12
GCD is 4 (found using a recursive approach)
